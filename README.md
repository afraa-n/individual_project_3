# Databricks ETL (Extract Transform Load) Pipeline

### PURPOSE

The purpose of this repo is to develop a data pipeline using Databricks. The primary goal is to create an efficient and functional pipeline that includes at least one data source and one data sink.

Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201)

***

### PROCESS

The code performs ETL-Query operations:  
Extract (E): Extract a dataset from a URL in CSV format.  
Transform (T): Utilizes Spark SQL to amalgamate two datasets, ensuring they are primed for analysis.  
Load (L): Transfers the transformed data into the destination data store, leveraging Delta Lake.
